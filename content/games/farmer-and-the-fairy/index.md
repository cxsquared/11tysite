Farmer and the Fairy is an adventure game built in [MonoGame](https://monogame.net/) for [Crossroads Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/crossroads-jam-2024). I teamed up with my friend [Chops](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422570/EchoBlade/) which his main engine of choice is MonoGame so I thought I'd give it a go. I actually really enjoyed using MonoGame which wasn't a huge surprise to me since I use C# in my day job. The biggest thing I enjoyed about this jam was working with [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) to work on building out a quick map editing system. I also injected a lot of my personal self into the game via a secret area. This was the first game jam with the local Indianapolis IGDA chapter so I was feeling very connected to the community which inspired me to put more of myself into the game. As I grow older I find myself pulling more and more on my life to try and make my games better. Feel free to download it and give it a go over on Itch.io.
