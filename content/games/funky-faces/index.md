Funky Faces was my entry into the 2024 global game jam. The theme was "Make Me Laugh" and I thought what better way to make someone laugh than by forcing their face to do it. I was inspired by Mario 64 and [Who's Lila](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1697700/Whos_Lila/). I had also been getting into water color so I decided I wanted to make all the art physically with water color for the game. I hadn't really used Godot before and was lucky enough to have RedWheeler help me out on the programming side. Feel free to check it out on Itch.io.
