Welcome to Yoga Therapy!  You are a yoga therapist, helping inexperienced yogis and yoginis realign all their chakras by bending them into shape!

Although things are mostly chill in Yoga Therapy, if you align your patient's body into the Dark Yoga Pose, you may unleash their inner demon.

It's yoga time!

The Global Game Jam theme of "Roots" ties into yoga by way of the chakras/bonds.  Aligning the first chakra, the Muladhara / Root Chakra is the essential first step in regulating the prana (energy) throughout your body.  In order to keep this prana in, you need to engage your Mula Bandha (root lock).  Often, you'll hear this cued as "Rooting In" in yoga.

How To:

Although there are instructions in the game, you'll select various parts of the patient's body with the D-pad and move them into shape with the crank.

Docking the crank will finish the yoga therapy session and you can move through helping three different patients with different stretching needs!
