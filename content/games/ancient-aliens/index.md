My teams entry for the Global Game Jam 2016. Han Wu is setting up for the yearly fireworks ritual when some thing goes terribly wrong and he is launched into space and abducted by aliens. He must fend off the aliens to get back home. This is a single stick shooter. Use the mouse to aim. You can also use a controller joystick to aim.
