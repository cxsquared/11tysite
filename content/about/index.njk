    <p>
      Since you've stumbled upon this site I'll tell you a little about myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is Cody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently I'm a full time programmer and hobbyist game developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main focus is in audio programming and how audio can be made better for video games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of programming I love watching british panel shows, hockey, and pretty much any form of motor sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with watching motor sports I'm frequently participating in open wheel leagues in iRacing.
